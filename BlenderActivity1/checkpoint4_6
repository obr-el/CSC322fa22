Checkpoint 4: Compare the images from Checkpoint 2 and Checkpoint 3. Discuss the effect of changing the resolution.
  The sphere in Checkpoint 3 is smaller and less detailed. Higher resolution allows for a higher quality image.
Checkpoint 6: Compare the images from Checkpoint 2 and Checkpoint 5. Discuss the effect of changing the gamma value.
  The gamma value in Checkpoint 5 is greater and the sphere and background in Checkpoint 5 both appear lighter than in Checkpoint 2. Changing the gamma value made the colors change.
